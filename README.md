Hi! This is my personal blog/website using [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) with the [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi) theme.

I'm also going to put current projects that I'm working on and put status updates into posts.

## build
run zola build
```bash
zola build 
```  
host the `public` folder  
profit

to all employers/others of that type, [nyadiia.dev](https://nyadiia.dev) will show off what i can do much better than this mostly silly blog.
