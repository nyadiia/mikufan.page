## but.. why?
rebuilt my website again but this time based around the [zols ca](https://github.com/getzola/zola) static site generator which allows me to write blogs easier ~~also because it's written in Rust~~. originally i just wanted my website to look cool and then be a blog as a secondary thing but i think this redesign might stick.

## theming
i mayyy go back to the old redesign but that's a lot of effort to rewrite an entire theme from "scratch". i'm currently using [archie-zola](https://github.com/XXXMrG/archie-zola) as the theme. i wanted to use [terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) but i already know someone that is using that theme and i don't want them to think i'm just copying off of them. also, i really like how this one actually shows the little header things in the blog post.

## what's next?
i'm going to eventually add a projects tag to put both of my ongoing projects, [tehda](https://github.com/nyadiia/tehda), a wofi replacement in Rust, and [minne](https://github.com/nyadiia/minne), a little todo application using a tui interface. tehda
it has very basic functionality, you can search and run things, but we're working on adding a bunch including theming, different modes, etc. minne is currently my personal project. i made it because i wanted to have a todo list but i didn't like over overbearing [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) looked and i just wanted something to be a little reminder without a ton of features. i also looked at [todoist](https://todoist.com/) but it felt like wayyy too much.

## update on miku.mikufan.page
i'm planning on reworking this, dw. i'm still not sure if i want it to be only ascii art or if i want to expand it to just being collection of cool miku images. i might accept pull requests on the [website's repository](https://github.com/nyadiia/mikufan.page) a little something like [cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) except not with an intentionally bad naming scheme. i may also better integrate it with the main site instead of having it on it's own subdomain, maybe moving it to `https://mikufan.page/miku` instead.
  
that's all for now, have a good day! :3
