I think that wireless earbuds have been harming me for a few reasons

# Isolation
I have the Pixel Buds Pro which has active noise cancellation. The passive noise cancellation from them just being in my ears is still pretty good, but ANC cuts out pretty much everything. Sometimes this is nice, I live in a city and it gets loud due to construction and whatever, especially at night because of the college bars. I feel as if I've been wearing them *too* much tho, I put them in whenever I walk out the door and press shuffle on my liked songs in Spotify.

# Intent
I don't even wear them for any particular reason anymore, if I'm travelling alone to a place, I pop in the headphones and turn on music. I think this is part of the reason I don't listen to my downloaded music more often, I just let the "audio feed" of Spotify smart shuffle take me on whatever journey it wants. I want to be able to turn on an album instead of the unlimited algorithmic slop, the ease of use of earbuds makes this even worse.

# People
One of the other main reasons I put in headphones is to avoid talking to people but I feel like it's not even good for that. My hairstyle covers up my earbuds anyways so there's no external signifier that I'm listening to music and don't want to be conversed with. Then whenever people do talk to me, I get annoyed that they're trying to talk to me with headphones in ( internally ofc, I'm not the type to go "I have headphones in. What?" ). 

# Solution
Something that would work much much better for the purposes I think I desire in headphones are some overear headphones, probably with a form of ANC. It's way too nice to give up and I don't exactly want to wear my earbuds underneath a big pair of headphones. The thing that I fear is that I would wear them too often like I do with earbuds, however I think I wouldn't do this in reality. I do not want to become the [TOG](https://etog.orbit.meownik.com/) who always wears them. I want to wear them with intent, which is still going to be isolation but moreso intentional isolation, it would also signify to others that "Hey! I do not want to be talked to right now, please do not interrupt whatever I'm doing!" altho, I've heard that people tend to just ignore this because of the people who are always wearing them.
