# comments??
yeah! if you scroll down to the bottom you'll see a neat little embed for [hyvortalk](https://talk.hyvor.com/) comments. *theoretically* i'd do something else that's self hosted but i think this will do for now, plus! it does moderation for me which is good for someone who barely posts.

# security??? it's a static website you dummy
honestly, i just wanted the A+ on mozilla observatory but it's also because of the newly implemented comments. it doesn't really do anything right now but if i were to move to a self hosted thing in the future, i wouldn't have to worry about XSS attacks against a... docker container. yeah i think it's overkill but it's good experience regardless!

anyways that's all for now, see you later!
